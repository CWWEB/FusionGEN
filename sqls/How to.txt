In order for the extended armory to fully function you will need to execute an SQL correlating to your realm version

IE: If you run a 3.3.5a realm, you will need to take use of data_wotlk_(3.3.5a).sql

Instructions
1. Unzip data_wotlk_(3.3.5a).rar
2. Execute data_wotlk_(3.3.5a).sql whilst targeting your FusionGEN Database
3. Access Application/cache and delete folders named "data" and "template"
4. Reload your website and you should be good to go!

- The entire folder named sqls can be deleted after the steps have been carried out
- Please be aware that there are some minor bugs with the extended armory version and we will most likely be attempting to correct these at a later time.

FusionGEN Maintainers
